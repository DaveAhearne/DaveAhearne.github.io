                <h2>The fear of percieved failure, software development & the tutorial trap.</h2>
                <p>
                    Teaching children to draw seems to be much easier than teaching adults to draw.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you give a child a set of crayons or paintbrushes they will usually have already enthusiastically
                    picked them
                    up and started to decorate the canvas (or anything else nearby) before you can even begin to explain
                    that they have the freedom to draw
                    literally <em>anything</em> that they like.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But adults? Adults are <strong>different</strong></span>.
                </p>

                <p>There is even a name for the anxiety that comes from this. <strong>"Blank Page Syndrome"</strong>. But why don't children have this?</p>

                <h3>The Fear of Failure</h3>
                <p>The reason that children have this approach is that they have not yet been burned by failure. The
                    hand that touches the hot stove will not touch it again, but the hand that has never touched the
                    stove is usually pretty enthusiastic about the whole thing...</p>

                <p>But adults know it well, they know how much it hurts because of experiences like:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Working really hard on something, only for it to be mocked. <em>"What is this, did you even try?"</em></li>
                    <li>Seeing someone else be an expert at a particular skill or hobby, and feeling devastated as a beginner because you can't do the most "simple" things</li>
                    <li>c</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The problem is that while the strategies that help us avoid physical pain <em>(and a burned hand)</em> inhibit
                    our ability to learn and grow. learning is painful and uncomfortable. It is the process of taking
                    what was familiar, and struggling with a new concept, discarding what was familiar and contending with the unknown.</p>


                <h3>Retreat to Process and Familiarity</h3>
                <p>Most people will retreated to one of two defence mechanisms when this happens</p>

                <strong>Become comfortable being uncomfortable</strong>

                <h3>What is List Comprehension?</h3>
                <p>
                    List comprehension is a compact way to process and create lists in Python. It’s an elegant
                    alternative to using loops for creating lists, and it can significantly reduce the number of
                    lines
                    in your code.
                </p>
                <pre><code>squares = [x ** 2 for x in range(10)]
print(squares)</pre></code>
                <p>
                    The output will be:
                </p>
                <pre><code>[0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]</pre></code>
                <p>
                    In this fake placeholder content example, the list comprehension [x ** 2 for x in range(10)]
                    generates a list of squares for the numbers 0 to 9.
                </p>
                <h3>Benefits of List Comprehension</h3>
                <img src="images/dog.png" alt="Image of Dog">
                <p>
                    Here’s why you should consider using list comprehension in Python:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Conciseness: List comprehensions reduce the code length. Instead of writing a full loop, you
                        can create the list in a single line.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Clarity: For simple operations, list comprehensions can make your code easier to understand
                        at a
                        glance.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Performance: List comprehension is faster than traditional loops because it’s optimized for
                        performance under the hood.
                    </li>
                </ul>
