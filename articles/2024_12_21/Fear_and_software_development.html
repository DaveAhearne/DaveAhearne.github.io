                <h2>The fear of percieved failure, software development & the tutorial trap.</h2>
                <p>
                    Teaching children to draw seems to be much easier than teaching adults to draw.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you give a child a set of crayons or paintbrushes they will usually have already enthusiastically
                    picked them
                    up and started to decorate the canvas (or anything else nearby) before you can even begin to explain
                    that they have the freedom to draw
                    literally <em>anything</em> that they like.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But adults? Adults are <strong>different</strong></span>.
                </p>

                <p>There is even a name for the anxiety that comes from this. <strong>"Blank Page Syndrome"</strong>.
                    But why don't children have this?</p>

                <h3>The Fear of Failure</h3>
                <p>The reason that children have this approach is that they have not yet been burned by failure. The
                    hand that touches the hot stove will not touch it again, but the hand that has never touched the
                    stove is usually pretty enthusiastic about the whole thing...</p>

                <p>But adults know it well, they know how much it hurts because of experiences like:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Working really hard on something, only for it to be mocked. <em>"What is this, did you even
                            try?"</em></li>
                    <li>Seeing someone else be an expert at a particular skill or hobby, and feeling devastated as a
                        beginner because you can't do the most "simple" things</li>
                    <li>c</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The problem is that while the strategies that help us avoid physical pain <em>(and a burned
                        hand)</em> inhibit
                    our ability to learn and grow. learning is painful and uncomfortable. It is the process of taking
                    what was familiar, and struggling with a new concept, discarding what was familiar and contending
                    with the unknown.</p>


                <h3>Retreat to Process and Familiarity</h3>
                <p>Most people will retreated to one of two defence mechanisms when this happens, </p>

                <p>avoidance or process, they will avoid the problem by procrastinating "I'm not in the mood right now,
                    I want to do X/Y/Z"</p>


                <h3>Material Hoarding and the Tutorial Trap</h3>

                <p>People will do this thing where they'll say, oh I can't do X yet - i'll look for a tutorial, so they
                    find a tutorial they'll buy it. Some motivated people will start progress on the tutorial if they're
                    truly interested but then the tutorial ends. Then the fear creeps in...</p>

                <p>The problem is that these people are not comfortable attempting a problem without having their hand
                    held, so they are always looking for the next source of hand holding to jump to. However, there is
                    good news.</p>

                <p><strong>Building software isn't like constructing a building</strong>. If you're constructing a
                    building the foundations are critical, anything built upon weak foundations is doomed to failure, no
                    matter how nice your brickwork is, no matter how much time and money you spent picking out those
                    curtains, it must come down.</p>

                <p>This means that before you make any decision you have to be <em>sure</em> it's the right one, because
                    your mistakes multiply and there is a real risk of time and money being lost.</p>

                <h3>Where do you go from here?</h3>

                <p>Software however, is <strong>not</strong> like construction at all, <em>(see the history of the
                        waterfall methodology)</em>. It is not only possible to completely re-do the foundations of a
                    software project halfway through construction, sometimes it is even necessary!</p>

                <p>Think instead of your software as a thick oil painting, a beautiful canvas where experiments have
                    been performed, some successful, some not and painted over hundreds and hundreds of times.</p>
