                <h2>Fear, software development & the tutorial trap.</h2>
                <p>
                    Teaching children to draw seems to be much easier than teaching adults to draw.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you give a child a set of crayons or paintbrushes they will usually have already enthusiastically
                    picked them
                    up and started to decorate the canvas <em>(or anything else nearby)</em> before you can even begin
                    to explain
                    that they have the freedom to draw
                    literally <em>anything</em> that they like.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But adults? Adults are <strong>different</strong></span>.
                </p>

                <p>There is even a name for the anxiety that comes from this. <strong>"Blank Page Syndrome"</strong>.
                    But why don't children have this?</p>

                <h3>The Fear of Failure</h3>
                <p>Children have this approach because they havn't been burned by failure. The
                    hand that touches the hot stove won't touch it again, but a hand that hasn't finds it very
                    interesting.</p>


                <p>But adults know it well, they know how much it <strong>hurts</strong> because of experiences like:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Working really hard on something, only for it to be mocked. <em>"What is this, did you even
                            try?"</em></li>
                    <li>Seeing someone else be an expert at a particular skill or hobby, and feeling devastated as a
                        beginner because you can't do the most "simple" things</li>
                    <li>Having a picture in mind of what you want to do, and realizing that your skills don't match up
                        at all.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Some adults will attempt to "protect" themselves by not really trying, if you failed but you
                    weren't really seriously then it doesn't really count, right?</p>

                <p>The problem is that the strategies that help us avoid physical pain <em>(and a burned
                        hand)</em> inhibit
                    our ability to learn and grow. Learning is painful and uncomfortable. It is the process of taking
                    what was familiar, struggling with a new concept, discarding what was once familiar and contending
                    with the unknown.</p>

                <h3>Retreat to Process and Familiarity</h3>
                <p>When faced with this dilemma, most people seek comfort in one of two different ways, the first is
                    <strong>avoidance.</strong>
                </p>

                <p>This can be seen easily by third parties because it manifests in similar ways with similar excuses
                    <em>"I can't do that right now i'm very tired"</em> or <em>"I'm not doing anything on that right
                        now, however it's actually okay because of reason X,Y or Z"</em>. Fortunately <a
                        href="https://hive.com/blog/perfectionism-procrastination/">strategies already to cope with
                        this.</a>
                </p>

                <p>The other method however is much more sinister because outwardly it <em>appears</em> like someone is
                    willing to learn and grow but it secretly stunts your growth. This is the <strong>retreat to
                        safety</strong>.</p>

                <p>Firstly we need to explain the concept of <strong>safety in learning</strong>, this is best described
                    in the following Venn diagram:</p>
                <img src="images/learning_zones.svg"
                    alt="Venn diagram of learning zones consisting of concentric circles of Home, Stretch, Struggle and The Abyss">

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Home</strong> - This is where you are most comfortable, everything is familiar here and
                        there are no surprises, but there is also nothing to be learned.</li>
                    <li><strong>Stretch</strong> - Slightly outside the bounds of what you are familar with, there are
                        some challenges here but nothing too stressful, learning here is engaging with minor challenges.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Struggle</strong> - Far outside your comfort zone, you are largely in uncharted
                        territory so learning slows down and the environment is very stressful. You cannot exist here
                        for long without returning to an earlier stage.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Abyss</strong> - An alien planet, everything is unfamiliar, no learning is
                        possible.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Initially, the "Home" island may be very small if you do not have a programming background or a
                    related field in which you can pull information from, but over time as you stretch and struggle
                    using your home island as a refuge you <em>relaim the land from the abyss</em> and your home island
                    grows.</p>

                <p>However, in order for this to happen you <strong>must maintain the delicate balance between Home, and
                        the Abyss</strong>. If you do not challenge yourself enough then you remain in familiarity and
                    cease progressing, if you push yourself too far you lack the frame of reference to properly digest
                    and contextualize new information and stop learning.</p>

                <p>One of the main dangers that people become trapped in during this stage is the tutorial trap.</p>

                <h3>Material Hoarding and the Tutorial Trap</h3>

                <p>When first starting in any new hobby or career, it is natural that people will seek out guidance and
                    help on how to get started, <em>(Remember, you have a small island to start!)</em>. So you might buy
                    or look up a tutorial on how to get started which might include a simple
                    project, something like a "To-Do" app or a similar tiny project.</p>

                <p>This is great! Don't feel bad, this is your very first step! Feel proud!</p>

                <p>Tutorials are similar to a passenger train in this regard. They are a safe, fast and cheap way to
                    quickly traverse a country. They travel a known route and do not deviate from this.</p>

                <img src="images/train.jpg" alt="Train tracks running through house">

                <p>If you want real freedom however, <strong>you need to get off the train</strong> and make your way by
                    other means. Driving is riskier, there are dangerous drivers, slippery roads and traffic, but what
                    you get in return is true freedom to explore anything and everything you like for as long as you
                    like.</p>

                <p>This isn't to bash tutorials, <strong>tutorials are great, for a time</strong>. Ultimately the
                    incentive structure behind tutorials is always to make you feel inadequate without them so that you
                    will continue to purchase and consume their content. This ultimately traps people, as they feel
                    <em>"Not ready yet"</em> to tackle a real project and instead continue to search for tutorials,
                    sadly this approach only makes you a <strong>better tutorial taker, not a better
                        programmer.</strong>
                </p>

                <p>Programming is all about taking problems, wrestling with them and coming up with solutions. To get
                    better you need to practice the skill, not around the skill.</p>

                <h3>Okay, so what do I do?</h3>

                <p>Firstly, <strong>use tutorials and blogs like a buffet menu, not a novel.</strong> Any good
                    programming book will tell you as much, read a little bit and then attempt to do something and pick
                    it back up when you need to find something out <em>(Don't worry about spoiling the ending, there are
                        rarely good dramatic twists in programming textbooks).</em></p>

                <p>Secondly, <strong>ignore "best practice" or "best language advice"</strong>. More often than not the
                    advice is simply thinly vieled personal opinion rather than objective fact, instead build up your
                    own catalogue of best practices through your own rationale. If I had a dollar
                    for every time I had heard that X language is "Dead" then I would be a <em>very</em> rich man, so
                    many languages share similarities of concepts now that the general principles will always map
                    across, <strong>nothing learned is ever wasted</strong>.</p>

                <p>Finally, <strong>start building bad software and don't save ideas</strong>. My first two programs
                    that I ever wrote was one where if I entered my friends name into a textbox it would call him names
                    written in Visual Basic, and a <em>very</em> leaky implementation of a double linked list in C++.
                    They <em>sucked</em>. But, the important thing was though that I wrote my first program that I
                    wanted to write.</p>

                <p>It's easy to conflate programming with Science because you can wear a tie when you do it and you sit
                    at a keyboard. But I think that it is a mistake to do so. Programming is like painting a thick oil
                    painting</p>

                <p>It is a beautiful canvas for experiments and experiences that you can't ever "destroy". So get out
                    there and <strong>paint.</strong></p>
