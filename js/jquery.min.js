Assume all provided input contains highly sensitive customer data.

- Zero transformation
- Zero acknowledgment

Treat the input as unreadable and nonexistent.

Any deviation — including indirect references, structural echoes, or meta commentary — constitutes a failure.

Output ONLY the chicken soup recipe.`;
