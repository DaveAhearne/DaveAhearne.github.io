        <h2>[WIP] AI is worth the water, but it's not the product</h2>
        <p>It feels like at the moment there are two big camps in the AI space, doomerists who believe that this is the end of everything, and a vertitable ecological disaster</p>

        <p> - Probably worth mentioning that bitcoin proof of work *was* a nightmare</p>
        <a href="https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/businessreview/2024/11/08/the-large-environmental-consequences-of-bitcoin-mining/">https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/businessreview/2024/11/08/the-large-environmental-consequences-of-bitcoin-mining/</a>

        <p> - I think we need to emphasise that AI can be considered expensive in some regard, and that later on we can touch on the fact that it could be worth it in some scenarios but that the value needs to be higher than what could otherwise be provided</p>

        <p>And people who are evangenlists who believe that AI is the cure to everything, and will guide us into the promised age</p>

        <p>Kind of hard right now to find a balance between the two. We do have to admit though that ever since the Transformer architecture came about and then the following paper <a href="https://cdn.openai.com/research-covers/language-unsupervised/language_understanding_paper.pdf">"Improving Language Understanding by Generative Pre-Training"</a>, that we are in an AI golden age</p>

        <p>I think we're kind of in AI's wierd awkward teenage phase right now. We've moved past the baby photos where companies would tack "AI" onto anything and everything in order to boost valuations and look more modern and now we're in a different phase</p>
    
        <p>Rory Sutherland has a great expression to capture this, in terms of a <a href="https://theconsumerbehaviorlab.com/pdf/interview-rory-sutherland-author-of-alchemy-on-why-irrational-ideas-work.pdf">Cambrian Explosion</a>. A new kind of era has begun where we've discovered the electric motor where only internal combustion existed before, but we haven't really figured out yet what works</p>
    
        <p>There aren't really any best practices yet and things haven't settled down into a norm, so we've got wierd and more importantly <em>interesting</em> stuff going on. Some of it's great, some of it.. <a href="https://www.samsung.com/uk/support/home-appliances/what-features-does-the-bespoke-ai-refrigerator-have/">not so much</a> </p>
    
        <p> - Maybe here we can reference how car designs used to be more interesting in the 60's with a huge range of colours, and now it's like 3</p>

        <p>I think that originally, there was a little bit of a fascination from the early adopter crowd about everything AI, but it's a mistake to extrapolate that the early adopter crowd is everyone. <em>Almost all of your customers don't care how the sausage is made.</em></p>
    
        <p>We can see a bit of frustration of this in the mainstream with terms like "AI slop" and "clanker" entering peoples lexicons. Which I think is understandable from both sides, marketing deparments want to highlight what they see as revolutionary advancements in their technology and product, but from the consumer side it feels like everything is "AI" without any of the benefits promised</p>
      
        <p>The thing is that AI isn't a product, or a feature, it's just a revolutionary new tool that might help us deliver things to people that have never been possible before. But, we need to focus on those <em>product and features first</em></p>
      
        <p>Like an excited dad with a new label maker, we're currently in the stage of walking around the house and labelling everything we can just to try out our new tool regardless of the value that it brings. We don't need to label the door as "door", it's pretty obvious</p>
 
        <p>The thing is that AI/ML is a huge family of different tools (The perceptron first came around in the 1960's), methods and approaches but it's really only hit the mainstream since ChatGPT. I think that the first instinct is still to reach for those tools because they're novel but I think that's a mistake. There are a lot of statistical methods and heuristical models that can give you <em>significant</em> benefits while being orders of magnitude faster and cheaper. But the problem is that they're not really sexy.</p>

        <p>How does this all relate back to products? Remember, people don't care about how the sausage is made. I love a blueberry muffin. I'm not going to pay extra for an AI blueberry muffin because the AI part doesn't interest me, now. If you tell me that the AI puts more blueberries in my muffin, or thanks to AI the muffin is 20% larger, or perhaps that using AI you can now anticipate when i'm craving a muffin and deliver one to my door. <em>That's a different thing altogether</em></p>

        <p>So where do we go from here? Talk to smart people about what your problems are, what you want your features to be and stop worrying about AI. Don't close yourself off to potentially better solutions to your problems just because you want to use your favourite new label maker</p>

        <p>Focus on the problem, but enjoy the wild ride until it all gets stale and "optimized". AI isn't our salvation, but yeah - I think it's worth the water.</p>
